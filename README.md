# 👋 Hi, I'm Twinkle Jaineera  
**Full-Stack Developer | AI Infrastructure Engineer | Cloud-Native Systems**

I’m a backend-focused engineer building scalable systems and integrating machine learning into real-world applications. With a strong foundation in Java and Python ecosystems, I work at the intersection of cloud engineering, ML deployment, and AI alignment. I’m especially interested in how controllable and autonomous systems can be built safely and responsibly.
